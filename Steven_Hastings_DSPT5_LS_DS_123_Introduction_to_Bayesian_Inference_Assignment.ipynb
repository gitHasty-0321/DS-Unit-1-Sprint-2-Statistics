        "the bayesian school of thought runs more on logic and reasoning it seems and has more faith in intuition which allows it to more accurately shed light on probabilities that are more often than not inherent and familiar to us. While 'leaving your bags at the door' is a fine notion under the pretense that we've seen plenty and retained none.  It smecks of a super-philosophy that leaves very little meaning to anything at all other than DATADATADATADATA! With that said I find it difficult to imagine the person/statistician of higher level cognitivity dedicated solely to the Frequentist approach where one can be so consumed by straight and narrow reasoning, feeding to an almost pious temperence that they can't see the forest for the trees.  Are devout frequentists really a thing???   Serious question. . ? Updating prior beliefs with data is just a fancy way of saying 'learning'. I think therefore I am . . . or 'there is more on heaven and earth horatio, than exists in your philosophy.  Maybe these frequentists really are touched by a higher power.  Or, maybe they missed the evolutionary boat of an upright posterior. . . BAM! Foot-in-mouth, end rant.  There is a strong probability I just don't know what the hell I am talking about.  \n",
