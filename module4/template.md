# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
* Speech 
* literature 
* musical theory 
* childhood development and rearing techniques
* Sound
* Communication
* Innovative education
* Future use of Virtual and Augmented Reality
* Film (which really just ties into my love for the art of story-telling)
* Jordan Peterson, Bret and Eric Weinstein, Ben Shapiro. . . but not so much that Sam Harris guy.

What do you know about?
* Literature
* Music Theory
* Linguistics
* Film theory/history
* 3D modeling and I have spent a good many hours arguing faults, theory and potential applications for V.R.
* aside from that I am just a man who is willing to learn. . . Or, update my beliefs. 

What decisions do you face?
* Your typical bootstrapped-single-dad-dilemas 
* Geographical displacement 
  - Which implies a seperation from a family that has been very helpful in assisting me with raising a child.
* Narrowing down a career trajectory
* Completing this module. 
* saving VR from itself
* redefining the cursory communication that exists between man and machine. 
* Paying rent or overdue car payment or groceries
  - (It's like college all over again except this time pairs_bootsrap_fatherhood and this time I actually give a shit)
* Finding a relocation point that benefits me, yes, but I really would like the schools in the area where I end up to be top of the line for my son because I attended three seperate high schools growing up and I feel as though I and my fellow generation were mislead and underprepared.  

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Definition of geographic variation
: the differentiation of distinctive subdivisions from geographically isolated parts \
of a potentially interbreeding population due to restriction of interbreeding between fractions \
and natural selection of locally valuable mutations : the primary mechanism of subspeciation

? ? ?
Given my topic is based around finding the best fit location to move in the near future then geographic variation would play a key role in that decision.  Cost of living, school prestige, mean income, transportation, etc.

2. Trend related to the news
supposing my data reveals previously untapped significance where I stumble upon a colloquil misnomer and set the story straight.  
given the many parameters that go into relocation research if something is found then it would bear relevance to trending news.

3. Who does that?
I am not certain of the percentages yet but due to my prior knowledge that people are relocating every day across this planet I can be confident that the 'who' will be satisfied.

4. Answering a question people care about
I would hope to attain useful information that could benefit anyone now or in the future that faces a similar decision.

5. Valuable to businesses
businesses would definitely benefit from previously unknown knowledge about youth education rankings. 

6. What's the most popular?
there is plenty of data steeped in the top places to live 2020 that researches a good chunk of the data that I am certain I will be mulling over soon.

7. Cost/Money rankings
In this situation 6 and 7 are highly correlated and for good reason. 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
I have not yet done any research but I think it is safe to assume that the grass isn't always greener.  

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
to be candid. . . this assignment is proving to be an eye opener for just how little research I have done outside of the a-typical learning curve data sets.  

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
null hypothesis being 'any move to a top ten ranked city will result in no significant difference in the education system'
alternative hypothesis 'there is a significant difference in the quality of education amongst the top ten cities.'

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
is the true outcome of a young adults cognitive development independent of the schools they attend?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
yes

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
U.S News and World Reports
